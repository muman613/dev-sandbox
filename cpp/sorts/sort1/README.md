# Binary Tree insertion sort example
##### By Michael Uman

## Overview

This directory contains an example C++ (C++11) implementation of a binary tree insertion sort. This example utilizes several of the C++11 standard features including templates and lamba functions.

## Building

Simply execute `make` in the current directory.

## Testing

Test the code using the included `unsorted-words.txt` file in the repository. It is checked in compressed using the **xz** compression tool. To uncompress it simply execute the following:

    unxz unsorted-words.txt.xz

Once the wordlist is uncompressed you can run the sort algorith with the following command-line:

    ./sort1 unsorted-words.txt
